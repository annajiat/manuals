# Expert helpers

We mainly have expert helpers for large workshops.

* As an expert helper, your main job is to move between different
  groups and make sure that groups are doing well.
* You might be summoned to a group whose helper needs extra help, or
  take the place of a helper if a group doesn't have one.
* No one is expected to know everything, but an expert helper should be
  able to find a person who can answer, or confident enough to say
  they should move on.

* Make sure you have a new (newer than 15 october 2020) Zoom client,
  so that you can join arbitrary breakout rooms.
  * TODO: You should be able to join arbitrary breakout rooms.
* Report in zulipchat (or hackmd) how breakout rooms are doing, and
  the general pulse of the workshop.
