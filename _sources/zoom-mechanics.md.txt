## How to mute and unmute

In lower left corner of the client you can mute and unmute yourself.

In the *main room* during lectures, it is best to keep your microphone
muted in the main room unless you want to say something.  It's OK to
unmute and speak up.

If you are in a quiet place, it's best to stay unmuted in breakout
rooms and during discussions.  This will make discussion much
smoother - a quiet environment or headset microphone helps with the
flow a lot.


## Please use your real name (instead of a system default username)

Click on "Participants" (bottom, middle):

You can rename yourself by clicking the blue "Rename" next to your name:

<img src="img/rename1.jpg" width="400"/>

<img src="img/rename2.jpg" width="800"/>


## Indicate in your name if you are in a team and/or if you are a helper

If you are part of a team, please indicate your team name or number like this:

<img src="img/myteam.jpg" width="400"/>

If you are a helper, please indicate also:

<img src="img/myteam-helper.jpg" width="400"/>

This makes it easier for the workshop organizers to manage breakout rooms.


## How to signal if you are away from keyboard

Please select the "clock" symbol if you are away or otherwise busy:

<img src="img/clock.jpg" width="400"/>


## How to signal when you completed a task successfully

We will sometimes ask you to signal to us once you have successfully completed
an exercise or type-along step. You can do this using the green check symbol:

<img src="img/green.jpg" width="400"/>


## How to ask a question

If you want to ask a question please use the "hand" symbol:

<img src="img/hand.jpg" width="400"/>

If this symbol is not present in your Zoom client, you can type "\hand" in the
chat window:

<img src="img/chat.jpg" width="800"/>


## How to signal a technical problem or that you got stuck

If you hit a technical problem or got stuck somewhere in an exercise
or type-along, please let us know with the red circle symbol:

<img src="img/problem.jpg" width="400"/>

We will then probably ask you to unmute and briefly describe the problem and then based
on the problem and timing we may assign you into a separate virtual room with a helper where
they can resolve the problem.

Once we have assigned you a helper we will ask you and the helper to "Join
Breakout Room" (bottom right):

<img src="img/problem-breakout.jpg" width="800"/>


## How to give feedback on the speed

There are also signals for faster and slower and with this you can indicate to
us whether we should adjust the speed.


## Zoom doesn't have to fullscreen when someone shares their screen.

By default, when someone shares their screen, Zoom goes into
fullscreen mode.  This can be inconvenient when you need to see
multiple windows at once.  You can disable this with Settings → Screen
Share → "Enter full screen when participants share".
