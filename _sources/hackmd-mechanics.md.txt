# HackMD mechanics and controls

Hackmd is a syncing text editor online.  We use it to answer questions
and provide feedback without interrupting the main flow of the room.
Also, everyone can have a more equal share of time.


## Privacy

- Assume the HackMD is public and published: you never
  need to put your name there.

- The HackMD will be published on the website afterwards.  We will
  remove all non-instructors names, but it's easier if you don't add
  it at the start.

- Please keep the link private during the workshop, since since
  security is "editable by those who have the link".

- You can use `[name=YOURNAME]`, to name yourself.  We *will* leave
  these in unless they are negative comments.


## Basic controls

- At the top (left or right), you can switch between **view**,
  **edit**, and **split view and edit** modes.

- You write in [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) here.  Don't
  worry about the syntax, just see what others do and try to be like
  that!  Someone will come and fix any problems there may be.

- Please go back to view mode if you think you won't edit for a
  while - it will still live update.


## Asking questions

Always ask questions and add new sections at the very bottom (unless
you are answering to something old, but we don't look up that much).
You can also answer and comment on other questions, too.


Other hints:

- Please leave some blank lines at the bottom

- Please don't "select all", it highlights for everyone and adds a
  risk of losing data (there are periodic backups, but not instant).

- It can be quite demanding to follow the HackMD closely.  Keep an eye
  on it, but consider how distracted you may get from the course.  For
  things beyond the scope of the course, we may come back and answer
  later.
