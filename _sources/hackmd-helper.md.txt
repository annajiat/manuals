# HackMD helpers

We have one person who is a "HackMD helper".  This isn't the only
person that should edit and answer, but one person shouldn't have too
much else on their mind.

## General HackMD practices

Keep it formatted well:

- Tag names you see with `[name=XXX]` so that we can remove it later.
- Add a new `##` heading when a new *lesson* or similar thing is
  started (introduction, icebreaker, break between lessons, etc)
- Add a new `###` heading when a new *episode*, *exercise*, *break*
  (within exercise session)
- Ensure people are asking questions at the bottom, direct them there
  if they aren't


Update with meta-talk, so that learners can follow along easily:

- Anything important for following along should not be only said via
  voice.  It needs to be in the HackMD, too.
- New lessons or episodes, with links to them.
- For exercises, link to exercise and add the duration, end time,
  goals.  If these are unclear, bring it up to the instructor by voice.
- Add a status display about breaks.

Share it when necessary

- During breaks and other times, share the HackMD (including the
  notification about break, and when it ends).


Answer questions

- If there is an question that should be answered by the instructor by
  voice, bring it up immediately.
- During breakout sessions, watch for breakout rooms that need help
  and direct someone to that room.
- Two points of view on when to answer:
  - Answer questions right away
  - Wait some so that we don't overload learners
  - You need to find your own balance.
- Be careful that you don't give too long and involved answers, which
  take up too much mental energy from learners while they are
  learning.  It's a balance you should think about on your own.
